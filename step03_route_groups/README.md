# Next.js 13 Route Groups

The hierarchy of the app folder maps directly to URL paths. However, it’s possible to break out of this pattern by creating a route group.

A route group can be created by wrapping a folder’s name in parenthesis: (folderName)



[Read the Route Groups docs](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/defining-routes#route-groups)



We should use the <Link> component for navigation unless you have a specific requirement for using useRouter.


Start the Server:

        npm run dev

Open the Browser:

        http://localhost:3000/





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

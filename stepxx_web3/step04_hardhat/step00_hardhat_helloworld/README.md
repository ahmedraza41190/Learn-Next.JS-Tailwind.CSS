# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

[Before starting development please go through the Ethereum Developer Documentation in detail](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/)

[We will follow this getting started page](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/)


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

# Learning Solidity Essentials

In this directory we will create baby steps following this Text Book (Chapter 3 and onwards):

[Solidity Programming Essentials: A guide to building smart contracts and tokens using the widely used Solidity language, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Solidity-Programming-Essentials-building-contracts/dp/1803231181/ref=sr_1_2_sspa)

Each step will be a hardhat project including tests and deployment scripts.

You can also take help from this [repo](https://github.com/panaverse/defi-dapps-solidity-smart-contracts)
